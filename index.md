This is where I'm trying to store useful medical nuggets. I'm going to try and split
them into a few different types of page:

Recipes
: How-to articles - e.g. "Recipe: Investigating AKI" - a no-nonsense checklist of
  things to do in a situation

Understand
: How-to-think articles - e.g. "Understanding causes of AKI" - more detailed articles
  about the thought process that should go into a particular problem.

Notes
: Possible disorganised collections of notes and references about a topic. Mainly for
  me.
