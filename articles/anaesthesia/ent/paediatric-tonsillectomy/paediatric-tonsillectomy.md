# Pre-op

Not much to say.
Worth gauging indication: recurrent infection vs OSA (?doesn't make as much
difference in kids as adults)

# Intra-op

### Induction
Gas or IV both ok.
Can augment a gas induction with IV bolus of opiod+propofol once canulated.

### Airway management
Many, many ways to skin a cat...

1. "Trad": paralysis + tube (south-facing RAE)
2. Tube without paralysis...
    (a) Get them deep and just do it - best with kids < ~7 + not too fat
    (b) Topicalise the cords (but need to be NBM for ?1hr after)
3. LMA: flexi-LMA - arguably protects glottic opening better + facilitates
  spontaneous ventilation

### Emergence

*Important:* Beward the coroner's clot - **always** flex the neck supine +
suction for nasapharyngeal blood.

# Post-op
Usual paracetamol/NSAID/weak opiod combo.
